Yonsei University CSI4107 Human and Computer Interfaces HW1

Goal is to implement a simple scientific experiment with Processing. When you run your sketch, the canvas should have an acquisition zone. A circular target is periodically created at a point located on the other side of the canvas. The spawned target moves at a constant speed towards the acquisition zone. The participant of this experiment must press the button when the center point of the target is located inside the acquisition zone (see Figure 1). If the button is pressed while the target is in the acquisition zone, the trial is successful. If not, the trial is a failure. Regardless of success or failure, when the button is pressed, the target of the trial disappears immediately. Note that only one button press is allowed for one target (or one trial).
